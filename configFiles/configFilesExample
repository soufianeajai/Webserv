valid http redirection : 
301 Moved Permanently: This status code indicates that the resource has been permanently moved to a new URL. Clients and search engines should update their records to use the new URL for future requests.
302 Found: This status code indicates a temporary redirection. The resource is temporarily located at a different URL, and clients should continue to use the original URL for future requests.
303 See Other: This is used to redirect after a POST request to indicate that the client should retrieve a different URL using a GET request.
307 Temporary Redirect: Similar to a 302, but it indicates that the method and body of the original request should be reused when making the redirected request.
308 Permanent Redirect: Similar to 301, but it indicates that the method and body of the original request should be reused.


 Set a default file to answer if the request is a directory: 
location / {
}

"/" convert to root -> will be "/tmp/www/" if is directory -> default_file: /tmp/www/index.html  access() 


1 - 
directory_listing: on
default_file: index.html # exist
 -> he server will serve that file instead of showing the directory contents.

2 -
directory_listing: off
default_file: index.html # not exist
 -> 404 not found if not have redirection in same path
